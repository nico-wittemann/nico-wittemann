# 👨‍💻 Nico Wittemann – Backend Developer (Python · Django · PostgreSQL)

I'm a junior backend developer who focuses on building structured, real-world backend systems using **Python**, **Django**, **Flask**, and **PostgreSQL**.

Coming from an engineering background, I transitioned into software to build logic that runs online – APIs, databases, clean data flows.  
My projects are centered around backend architecture, authentication, and handling real data.
